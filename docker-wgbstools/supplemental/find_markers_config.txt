# This is an example for a find_markers configuration file.
# lines starting with "#" can be deleted, as they are ignored by the find_markers command
# The default values for all optional parameters (i.e. when they are set to "NA") 
# are specified in supplemental/find_markers_defaults.txt (which can also be edited by the user)
# every parameter can be specified with find_markers command line argument. 
# In case of contradiction, the command line argument prevails
# To summerize, command line > config file > defaults file
# To be certain, the de-facto parameters are dumped to OUT_DIR/params.txt

#########################

# Path to a blocks file. 
# The file must have at least 5 columns: chr, start, end, startCpG, endCpG
# if the blocks file is large, running time is much better when the blocks 
# are sorted  by startCpG (sort -k4,4n).
# this parameter is required.
blocks_path: NA

# groups file is a csv file with at least two columns, and a header line
# the first column is the names of the samples.
# another column named "group" contains the labels for the samples (group name)
# the find_marker tool finds a set of markers for each target group.
# By default, all groups are included as target groups.
# The tool compares each target group to all the other samples listed in the GROUPS_FILE ("background group")
# this parameter is required.
groups_file: NA

# It's possible to find markers for only subset of the groups, TARGETS.
# Note the background group will not be changed by using this parameter. 
# TARGETS is a space-separated list of groups/labels.
targets: NA

# It's possible to find markers only against a subset of the groups, BACKGROUND.
# If not specified, the markers will be found for all targets in a "one vs. all" manner.
# This is the default behaviour.
# Otherwise, background must be a subset of the groups in the group file.
# Each target in "targets" will be compared to all groups in the "background" set (excluding samples that belong the the current target).
# BACKGROUND is a space-separated list of groups/labels.
background:NA


# a list of beta files
# Can either be supplied directly (a string) or as file 
# all the samples listed in GROUPS_FILE must be listed in this list.
# files listed in BETAS / BETA_LIST_FILE but not in GROUPS_FILE are ignored.
# Exactly one of the parameters (betas, beta_list_file) is required. If both specified, BETAS is ignored

# a file with a list of beta file paths, each file in a new line
beta_list_file: NA

# a space separated list of beta file paths
# It may be more convinient to specify the beta files using the --betas flag
# E.g: wgbstools find_markers --betas /path/to/beta_files/*beta

# coverage filters
# MIN_COV (integer) is the minimal number of binary observations (CpG sites' statuses) a marker must have to be considered.
# A marker passes the filter if at most NA_RATE_TG of the target samples and at most NA_RATE_BG of the background samples have insufficient coverage (i.e. have <MIN_COV observations) in that marker
# For example, for MIN_COV=5, NA_RATE_TG=0, and NA_RATE_BG=.4, all found markers will have at least 5 observations in all of the target samples, and in at least 90% of the background samples.

#########################

# limit marker direction (hyper / hypo methylated):
# only_hyper - find only hyper-methylated markers (AKA "M" markers)
# only_hypo - find only hypo-methylated markers (AKA "U" markers)
only_hyper: False
only_hypo: False

# delta_means / delta_quants - the requested difference in methylation between target group and background group
# delta_means and delta_quants are fraction in range (0, 1)
# delta_quants: difference between group means
delta_means: 0.5
# delta_quants: difference between group quantiles
delta_quants: 0.0

# tg_quant - portion of the the target group to ignore/relax
# bg_quant - portion of the background group to ignore/relax
# for example, for bg_quant=.025 and tg_quant=.25, a "U" marker passes the test if the .75th quantile of the target group is smaller than the .025th of the background group by at least DELTA (e.g. 0.5).
# Similarly, a "M" marker passes if the difference between the .25th quantile of the target group is larger then the .975th quantile of the background group by at least DELTA.
# tg_quant, bg_quant are fracions in range [0, .5]
tg_quant: 0.25
bg_quant: 0.025

# meth_quant_thresh is a threshold for the low *quantile* methylation of the methylated group,
# i.e. the TG_QUANT of the target group (for "M" markers) or the BG_QUANT of the background group (for "U" markers)
# analygously, unmeth_quant_thresh is the threshold for the high quantile of the unmethylated group: 1-TG_QUANT of the target group for "U" markers.
# For example, for meth_quant_thresh=.7:
#   a "M" marker passes the test if the (TG_QUANT)'th quantile of the target group >=0.7.
#   a "U" marker passes the test if the (1-BG_QUANT)'th quantile of the background group >=0.7.
# unmeth_quant_thresh is a fraction in range [0, .5)
# meth_quant_thresh is a fraction in range (.5, 1]

# meth_mean_thresh is a threshold for the *average* methylation of the methylated group,
# i.e. the target group (for "M" markers) or the background group (for "U" markers)
# analygously, unmeth_mean_thresh is the threshold for the unmethylated group.
# For example, for meth_mean_thresh=.7:
#   a "M" marker passes the test if the average methylation of the *target* group >=0.7.
#   a "U" marker passes the test if the average methylation of the *background* group >=0.7.
