# Test for Rocker scripts

If changes are made to the Rocker scripts in PR,
use GitHub Actions workflow to test if they run correctly under multiple conditions.

This directory contains the Dockerfile used for the test build,
the test script file, and the matrix file that sets the conditions used in the test.
